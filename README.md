# Digimon API Application
This assignment utilizes the wonderfully simple Digimon API (https://digimon-api.vercel.app/) to do a few different functions during utilization. 
In synopsis, the program allows users to display a list of all the Digimon, search for specific Digimon, and view recently searched Digimon.  This allows users to create their dream Digimon team with ease.

# Features
As aforementioned there are three (count them) three methods that the user can utilize to search the Digimon API.  These include:
- Display Digidex with "/digi"
- Search specific Digimon with "/digi/{mon}"
- Display recently searched digimon (with use of a hashmap) with "/searched"

# How it works
This project runs with the heavy assistance of SpringBoot alongside Maven and is written in Java.  As aforementioned a litany of times, it is also exclusively using the Digimon API

# How to setup
This is a really easy code to run, just "git clone" the project url and put it in whatever folder you want.  Any sufficient IDE will work with it, in this instance I am using IntelliJ
